This is the second project from the Udemy Course: [**JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio**](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/)

#### Lessons Learned: 
- Good usage of Async Await Functions;
- Scroll EventListener and new window objects (innerHeight, scrollY, offsetHeight);
- Better Performance. Doing the first request with fewer photos in order that users with low band width can access the content widthout having to wait excessively;
